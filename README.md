### neural-nw-hyperparameter-tuning

NOTE: Due to system limitations, I have run the hyperparameter tuning in batches. The best approach would be to get the optimizations done considering all the hyperparameters in one shot. This code is also included at the end of the notebook.

Neural Network Hyperparameter Tuning - Batch size, Epoch, Learning rate, Drop out rate, Activate function, Kernal initializer and No.of neurons in activation layer.

**Information on Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset:**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
